## Usage

1. Download the latest build in the [Releases](https://github.com/karin0/osu-bdi/releases).
2. Start the executable you just downloaded. If it crashes immediately, you may need to specify the path to your Songs directory from the command line like `.\osu-bdi.exe --songs_dir "C:\Program Files (x86)\osu!\Songs"`.
3. Install the userscript from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/407062-osu-beatmap-downloaded-indicator) or [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karin0/osu-bdi/main/assets/script.js) in your browser. A userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) may be required.
4. Open the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) and you should see the effects after the page loads.
